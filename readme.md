## Common Test Patterns

### Basic Test Structure
```javascript
// example.spec.js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/);
});
```

### Page Object Model
```javascript
// pages/LoginPage.js
export class LoginPage {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.usernameInput = page.locator('#username');
    this.passwordInput = page.locator('#password');
    this.loginButton = page.locator('#login');
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    await this.usernameInput.fill(username);
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
    await this.loginButton.click();
  }
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful test names**: Describe what the test does
2. **Leverage auto-waiting**: Playwright waits for elements automatically
3. **Use data-testid attributes**: More reliable than CSS selectors
4. **Run tests in CI/CD**: Integrate with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
5. **Use fixtures**: Share common setup across tests
6. **Enable tracing in CI**: Helps debug failed tests
7. **Use soft assertions**: Continue test execution after assertion failures
